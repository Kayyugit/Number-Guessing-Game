    "***This is a brief explanation of why I have made this notebook. If you want to jump right into the code explanation, feel free to scroll down to the next cell.***\r\n",

    "**Picture this**: you've just finished watching a tutorial on YouTube on how to create some sort of app, write a certain kind of code or even create a game. After you're done, you have lines of code. Sometimes, you may have hundreds of lines of code. Okay. What next? If you 're just like me, and have poor memory, I think  this notebook may be useful to you. I started writing notebooks to try and explain, to the best of my understanding, the code I write, those I watched a video on, from websites or anywhere I may have encountered them. I like when things are over explained or over simplifi. Ththis notebook is how I do that to help myself understand and remember how code may work. Either as a whole, or how certain chunks of code may work. This is in no way trying to help memorize code. Instead, I am simply trying to breakdown blocks of code to understand how they work and keep a record of it so that if I want treo use that same function or code, I know exactly what I need and how it will affect my work. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "I'm still learning everyday and can't guarantee that this will be perfect but that's okay because the goal is progress not perfection. Also, the structure  of how code works means that some code will not work as an entirely separate operation outside a whole. For example, def functions are essentially a single entity and splitting it into parts is going to break it. This sucks because I would love to break things down and explain but it is what it Some code may not be included in the notebooks at all because they cannot run in the Jupyter Notebook e.g. code that requires the Pygame module or may have some sort of display. is. I'll try my best to still explain. I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me."
