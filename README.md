 Explainer Notebook for a number guessing game

This is a number guessing game. The user has 10 chances to guess the number between 1 and 50.

Also, there is an explainer notebook for the number guessing game. While this particular code may not be too complicated, I have still tried my best to explain, in as much detail as possible, how the code works. You can run the code in the notebook or find the code in the same repository.
